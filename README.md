Title: Chess Game

ChessBasics.java -> Driver that opens game.txt

*** works ***

- add pieces into the board through a txt
- move pieces using a txt
- space detection using findPiece()
- OutOfBoardException and IllegalChessMoveException
- ChessPiece as an abstract class of each piece class

*** doesn't work ***

- txt input works perfectly when there are no empty lines (adding pieces and moving pieces work) but they cannot have a separation
- to see an example: look how game.txt has no empty line between adding and moving pieces
